## About
Untitled German Book 1, or `germanbook1_unknown.md`, was taken from a book found at the spawn of [MedievalTales](medievaltales.mondcarion.group), a German-speaking Minecraft server. The book was found at spawn, although the coordinates were not written down, but the book was found in a birch house on the first floor in the overworld.
