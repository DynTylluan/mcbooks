Hi, I'm Cass and this is the first signed book on this server... AND YOU'RE READING IT!

I don't have much to say, but I guess I joined this server in the early days and made a little wooden and brick house near spawn, feel free to have a look if it's still there.

Anyway, hope you have a good time playing on this world and best of luck!
