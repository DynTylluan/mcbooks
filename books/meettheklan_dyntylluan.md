When You Meet A
Member Of The Ku Klux
Klan (1921)

When you meet a
member of the Ku Klux
Klan,
Walk right up and hit
him like a natural man;
Take no thought of
babies he may have at
home,
Sympathyâ€™s defamed
when used upon his
dome.

Hit him in the mouth
and push his face
right in,
Knock him down a
flight of steps and
pick him up again.

Get your distance
from him and then take
a running start,
Hit him, brother, hit him,
and please hit the
scoundrel hard.

Pour some water on
him, bring him back to
life once more
Think of how he did
your folks in the days
of long ago;
Make a prayer to
heaven for the
strength to do the
job,
Kick him in the
stomach, he, a low,
unworthy snob.

Call your wife and
baby out to see you
have some fun,
Sic your bulldog on
him for to see the
rascal run.

Head him off before
he gets ten paces
from your door,
Take a bat of sturdy
oak and knock him
down once more.

This time you may
leave him where he
wallows in the sand,
A spent and humble
member of the Ku Klux
Klan.
