# Rules by Unknown

## About
`rules_unknown.md` is a book that a player will automatically be given when they join the [GamersDorm.secure.pebble.host](https://www.planetminecraft.com/server/gamersdorm-server) server for the first time.

This is the second indexed book that is from this server, previously, there was [Rules](books/rules_xxacecutexx.md), written by [XxAceCutexX](https://namemc.com/profile/XxAceCutexX.1) that would be given to all new players. Seeing that this second book has a similar writing style, then this might also have of been written by the same user, although this might not be fact.

When spawned in the server for the first time, a new player will get the `rules_unknown.md` book, full leather armor that has been dyed red, 64 stone with Power III and Thorns V, 30 oak planks, 1 gold hoe, 1 feather, 1 campfire, 64 stakes, 1 wooden axe, 1 wooden pickaxe, and 1 wooden shovel.
