# Unsigned by wastebin

## About
`unsigned_wastebin.md` book found by the house of [wastebin](https://wastebin.neocities.org) (real Minecraft username unknown) at 415 / 67 / -619 on [the tilder server](https://mc.tildeverse.org) in the overworld.

The book was found in a chest with seemingly no other books around that location, even after looking.

Why these coordinates were written is unknown, as when going to 150, XXX, -25, nothing of note is seen there. If there _was_ anything to be seen, it is now gone.
