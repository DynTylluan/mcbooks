5th October 2020

After seeing Tomasino's video on Perrtube about tildeverse community, I decided to take a look at tildeverse.org website. While there I came across the Minecraft server address and decided to take a look.
           Now I am here

My memory between 2020-10-6 and
2020-10-16 is a bit blur and not included.

But some of the things I have started or completed building are:

- starting a medieval themed town about 2500 blocks away from the spawn. Named the town "Tildestan".

- constructing a road from Spawn to Tildestan. 1000 of 2500 blocks are completed. No columns are built yet.

- Building an egg powered gold farm that dind't work because pathfinding for mobs can be weird in multiplayer :/

- Building a donut shaped gold farm, It is accessible via "/warp nethergrinder3" command.

26 October 2020

I decided to start writing a diary of the things that I have done on this server.

I also worked a little on the road project but Raspikov's Cave base on my path. I don't know what I should do. I tried few solutions @ superflat.

27th October 2020

I decided to use 90 turn desings instead of going over Raspikov's cave or using diagonals. I hope not more houses are on my path.

I also built another floor on the tree farm.

28th October 2020

I was with dozens at his creeper farm. he has so many musics discs now and he even allows me take few from each. I may come back to complete my set. In fact I will leave at his creeper farm to surprise him :)

30th October 2020

I was at dozens' creeper farm when I logged in, he wasn't around yet though. I took many discs and completed my and planned diner's music disc sets. Then he logged in and I gave him the tour of Tildestan. Tildestan is still empty :\

1st November 2020

There were many new players online and Vanta was giving them the tour of the server. There also was another player settled on a platue next to a forest. I helped that player to claim that land.
Bartering System has an item sorter now.

2nd November 2020

I build about 400 more blocks length of the railroad project. I guess I am entering the last 700 blocks to build. But that is the concrete for the project. I still have to put levers to power the rails. And I am about 1800 blocks away for that :\

3rd November 2020

I hollowed the mountain near the Tildestan. I plan to turn it into a large storage system. Unlike the Vault in Spawn, Tildestan's Vault won't have animals. After all, Tildestan must be lag free.
Also built some more of the road.

4th November 2020

Spawn <-> Tildestan Rail Project Update

Phase 1, laying concrete road, & 2, powerrail placement, are COMPLETE. Anyone can take a minecart (almost) straight to/from both ends.

Phase 3, building pillars, is in action and allows everyone to build pillars under the road.
Of course, server rules such as "No building in rivers" apply.

I can't wait to see others' bridges designs, graffities and pixel arts.

Some time in January 2020

I logged in and placed the flooring in Tildestan Vault project. That place still is a torch spam. I would like to replace them with kinda randomly placed lanterns.

20 January 2020

I replaced torches with lanterns in lower level of Tildestan Vault. Since I don't place lanterns on the ground but hang from ceiling unlike torches, they aren't as effective as torches. 

I am also testing a wall desing.

21 January 2020

I placed barrels into walls, around the wall decoration.
I didn't touch to bridge level since desing in not final.

27th January 2020


Added barrels around the columns to make it look like items barrels wer unloaded in a disorganized manner.

28-29th January 2020

Roughly decided on what kind of items go where in the vault. Also cleared barrels that were holding the rubble (cobblestone etc) from hollowing the mountain where the vault is built.  

8th February 2021

Small touches here and there in Tildestan ;)

20th May 2021

I forgot to write for many days. Here is a summary.

> I started designing the "Ever Given" ship. It is just a desing in superflat for now.

> Started building the bridge infront of Tildestan vault.

> Started building a bamboo farm in nethergrinder3 for turning swords into nuggets.

Writing daily is difficult probably because spawn is too laggy for me. So I will write montly summaries from now on.

July 2021

People aren't building houses is Tildestan, I will need to build farmer, miner, blacksmith etc houses myself. Well, as the mayor, farmers built so far are funding the development.

Started to build big ~ sign at Tildestan.
