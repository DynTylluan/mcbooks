The Midnight Prowler
Cass "Owly" Python
2018-10-05

I am the Midnight
Prowler, son of the
moon,
and I am the child of
the 35th generation....

I wish for the day
that I will return to
England, so I may
once again walk upon
its pure virgin lands
of green fields, I wish
for my feet to touch
the soft long grass,
and feel the slow sea
on my skin, like we did
in the age of the
Gods.

I will fight for
England, I will fight
for what I believe is
right: Let us drink
knowing that England
will sleep well, knowing
that no Saxon man will
touch the pure, virgin
land of Great Britain!
If the Saxons try, and
touch our pure, and
most Holy land, then
we will take action, and
show them our metal!

I shed the blood of
the Saxon men!

I shed it at Verden!

I shed the blood of
the Saxon men!

I shed the blood of
four thousand Saxon
men!

I shed the blood of
the Saxon men!

Let the rivers run
red!

Let the rivers run
red with the blood of
the Saxon men!

Let the rivers run
red with the blood of
four thousand Saxon
men!

We shell rejoice in
knowing that the
Saxons do not have
God on their side, and
will die like fools. When
we have shown the
Saxons out mite, then
we shell drink for a
thousand, and one
years on the honey,
milk, and the fruits of
the Gods!

But until that day, may
I fight by my fellow
Christians, fighting the
good fight, and
believing what is right.
If my excalibur shell
slip in my hands, and a
Saxon man shell shed
my blood, I am content,
in knowing that my
blood will not be in
vain.

Death to the Saxon
men!
