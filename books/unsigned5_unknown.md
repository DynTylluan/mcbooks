# Unsigned by Unknown

## About
This unsigned book, `unsigned5_unknown.md`, was found somewhat a long way away from spawn at -47 / 61 / -1036 on [the tilder server](https://mc.tildeverse.org) in the overworld.

The book is unique as it was written in both English and Russia.

It was made in 2020 and was translated by someone called CoderSiri (this is not a Minecraft username) - as CoderSiri wrote that they were the one to translate this, it implies that they did not write the original text as someone would not need to say that they translated something if they wrote the original version of it.

The book makes reference to the player using the `/rtp` command - this will teleport a user to a random location in the server.

The text below was not edited in anyway.

  The initial location was chosen by the /rtp command.
  After the construction of a classic dugout on (), digging an uncomplicated mine on (), and growing a vegetable garden on (), things did not go any further.

  After exploring the area a more interesting place was found for justification - a lake on ().
  The lake was drained, and a shack was built in its place.
