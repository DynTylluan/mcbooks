# Rules by ohaitrans

## About
When a new player joins the [MC Magma Survival server](https://www.planetminecraft.com/server/mc-magma-survival-1-16-5-1-17-1) for the first time, they will be put into a hub world with a number of items, the Rules book, called here as `rules_ohaitrans.md`, as written by [ohaitrans](https://namemc.com/profile/ohaitrans.1), as well as a brick pickaxe, a brick sward, and a brick axe. They are also given 15 pieces of bread, 1 boat, 16 oak planks, and 8 oak saplings.

While copying the text from this book, [DynTylluan](https://namemc.com/profile/DynTylluan) also noticed that 20 or so seconds later, a copy of [How to Claim Land by BigScary](howtoclaimland_bigscary.md) also appeared.
