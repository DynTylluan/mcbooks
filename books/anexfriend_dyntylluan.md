To an ex-friend:

I am sorry that I was
rude to you, it was
unfair of me to be like
that, I should have
known better than be
rude to a friend.

I loved you so much
that it hurt me, I have
changed a lot since
thoses years ago, I am
a new person, but one

thign that is still the same
is that I still not only
care about you, but I
still love you.

Please, forgive me for
what I did.

Please.
