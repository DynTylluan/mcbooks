I'm superior to humans, says candidate

Extermination for student Phil

VOTERS had had to choose between a Tory and a Dalek ... and the Dalek won hands down.

The poll hopes of up-and-coming Conservative Philip Malcolm were exterminated.

The Dalek rolled up from outer space when Philip was on the verge of being elected to a top job in the National Union of Students.

"I am superior to all humans, it declared. "Vote for me." And 32 of them did, leaving Philip the loser by six votes in the contest for a committee post at the NUS Conference to Blackpool.

It just shows what a joke the NUS is," said Philip, tipped for

prominence in a new Tory student group.

The joker operating the Dalek was conference delegate Adam Gilchrist.

He studies at Birmingham University when he's not watching Doctor Who.
