# Unsigned by PingMastered

## About
This unsigned book, which was, in fact, renamed by an anvil to `Notes to ~Mrtz` but is still unsigned regardless, indexed in this archive as `unsigned_pingmastered2.md`, is a guestbook made by [PingMastered](https://namemc.com/profile/PingMastered.1), being found at -64 / 49 / 250 in the [tildeverse Minecraft server](https://mc.tildeverse.org).

It has a sister book by the same location, that being [`unsigned_pingmastered.md`](unsigned_pingmastered.md).

Four people have signed it; [vantablack420](https://namemc.com/profile/vantablack420.1), [beny9512](https://namemc.com/profile/beny9512.1), [the_pumpkin_man](https://namemc.com/profile/the_pumpkin_man.1), and [BattyCathy](https://namemc.com/profile/BattyCathy.1).

In the_pumpkin_man's comment in the book, the gold reference, is about when you turn one of the two books on the lecterns or open a chest, gold that was renamed to `Thanks for coming - ~Mrtz` will be spat out of a dropper.
