I want to help to the undercity, but I'm unsure how. Where can I get tons of dirt and torches ? Do you have chests with materials for construction ? Do you need more ?

response:

i just teleport far out then dig up some random area lol, and there should be coal at the vault for torches

i guess the chests by the hotel are a good start for a place to put materials, but mainly we just dig a

buncha dirt then dump it at the vault haha

also who is this?

thanks for wanting to help :D
